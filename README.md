# why do I need this app?
The main purpose of building this app is to record my exercise performance. Most importantly, to practice what I've learn lately.

I use JSP, Servlet, JDBC to bulid a MVC fashioned dynamic web project, which can opperate CRUD to manipulate information about my training sessions.
